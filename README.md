# ST7789
Library for ST7789-based IPS LCD with Raspberry Pi (SPI interface, 240x240 pixels, 7 pins without CS pin) - This is different from the [Pirimoni Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3787) with 12 pins. It is also missing the CS pin unlike the original. These 7 pin displays are mostly sold on Aliexpress and Banggood and are good value for money (Â£3-4), but a bit tricky to set up initially.
